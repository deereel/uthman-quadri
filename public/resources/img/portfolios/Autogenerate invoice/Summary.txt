Short Summary

This automation system manages the entire invoice lifecycle automatically. It generates branded PDF invoices from completed projects, emails them to clients, stores a copy in Google Drive, and updates Airtable with all relevant details. A second automation sends 7-day payment reminders, while a dashboard gives a full overview of outstanding payments, paid invoices, and monthly revenue. It eliminates manual invoicing, reduces billing delays, and improves operational efficiency.
