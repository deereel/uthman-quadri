Short Summary

This automation automatically manages client bookings from a Google Form. When a client submits the form, their response is added to a Google Sheet. The system then checks Google Calendar — if the event already exists, it updates it; if not, it creates a new one. This ensures all meetings are automatically scheduled, updated, and synced with reminder notifications, keeping your calendar accurate without manual work.
